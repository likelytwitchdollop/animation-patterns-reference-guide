# Animation Patterns Reference Guide
A collection of animation patterns for sidebars, staggered components, and more ( ˙▿˙ ).

<h3>Synopsis (￣ω￣)</h3>
 
<p>
  I got tired of trying to remember what I did when, how and where, so I’ll keep it all here (￣▽￣). I also figured someone else might benefit from this, so… ‘Hello, World! ╰(▔∀▔)╯’.
</p>

<p>
  P.S. This project is in it’s infancy and I add to it when I work on my projects. Framer Motion is my weapon of choice (sometimes), so the code snippets are written using Framer Motion. If you have implemented any of these patterns in or with CSS, the React Animated API, react-spring, GSAP or any other animation library, you can create a PR for it and I’ll add it.
